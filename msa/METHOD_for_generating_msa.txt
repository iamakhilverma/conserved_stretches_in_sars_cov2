The resulting alignment of 15 sequences is created using mafft v7.490 (2021/Oct/30) https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/mst010 in a single step:

Each sequence is individually aligned to the reference GenBank: MN908947.3. The alignments are created with the command:

	mafft --thread -1 input.fasta > output.fasta


Default parameters:
--fft, Use FFT approximation (FFT-NS-2) in group-to-group alignment
--6merpair, distance is calculated based on the number of shared 6mers
--retree 2, guide tree is built 2 times in the progressive stage
--memsave(Using the Myers-Miller 1988 algorithm) is automatically turned on when the alignment length exceeds 10k (aa/nt)
--op 1.53, gap opening penalty at group-to-group alignment
--ep .123, offset value, which works like gap extension penalty, for group-to-group alignment
--bl 62, BLOSUM number matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff 1992) is used
--inputorder, output order same as input order

# Identification of highly conserved stretches in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: implications on primer design for widely used diagnostic assays.

Thousands of mutations have been reported in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in over 2 years of extensive evolution (and adaptation) in humans. Widely used diagnostic assays including RT-PCRs and antigen/antibody detection assays may be adversely impacted by the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several reports and databases have systematically catalogued mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; nonetheless, the existence of long stretches of conserved nucleotides in the genome remains to be studied. We identified 11 stretches of at least 100 nucleotides (each) that are highly conserved (i.e. no mutations at a frequency of â‰¥ 0.1%) in over 6 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes including all the major variants of concern. These 11 conserved stretches may represent (a) key functional RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (b) good targets for antiviral therapy and (c) excellent targets for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays and other diagnostic assays. Interestingly, two of the conserved stretches lie within the region encoding the spike protein. Furthermore, all the 11 conserved stretches in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were highly variable across closely related human coronaviruses; thus, targeting these stretches will not only help improve the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays but will also make them highly discriminatory (i.e. enhance the specificity). Mapping of mutation frequencies in primer/probe binding regions of widely used RT-PCR assays reiterates the need for periodic monitoring of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its potential impact on clinical diagnostics.
